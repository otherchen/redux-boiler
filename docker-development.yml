            # creates volume to store node_modules - Since npm install is only run when the image is built, 
            # the installed node_modules would exist in the image but not the host. In addition, the above 
            # binding mounts the host's files on top of the container's files. Therefore, because the host
            # does not have node_modules, this binding causes the container to ignore the node_modules that 
            # were installed in the image and instead, mimic the host's state. Having this volume forces the
            # container to use the node_modules from the docker image, overriding the bind's effects.
